RFC 2119 for other languages
============================

The structure of RFCs is very useful for a variety of technical documents,
specially the key words for requirements levels can be used widely. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a> is
a reference for the reader of RFCs and documents structured alike. I therefore
interpreted it for German. Please feel free to fork and add other languages.
